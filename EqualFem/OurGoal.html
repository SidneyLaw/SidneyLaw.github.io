Dear Reader,
Welcome to Equal Fem, we cant wait to emmerse you in our Fem Fam. This publication is dedicated to educating others on the topics of feminism, gender equality, and sexual violence.
There is an overwhelmingly vast library of material on these topics, which causes most to give up on looking into the issues. That is when we here at EF realized that these complex issues are better swallowed in sips and not gulps. So enjoy the carefully currated articles, essays, and interviews inclosed.
